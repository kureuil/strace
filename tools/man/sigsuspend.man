NAME
       sigsuspend - wait for a signal

SYNOPSIS
       #include <signal.h>

       int sigsuspend(const sigset_t *mask);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       sigsuspend(): _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 1 || _XOPEN_SOURCE || _POSIX_SOURCE

DESCRIPTION
       sigsuspend()  temporarily  replaces  the  signal  mask  of  the calling process with the mask given by mask and then suspends the process until delivery of a signal whose action is to invoke a signal handler or to terminate a
       process.

       If the signal terminates the process, then sigsuspend() does not return.  If the signal is caught, then sigsuspend() returns after the signal handler returns, and the signal mask is restored to the state before  the  call  to
       sigsuspend().

       It is not possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP; specifying these signals in mask, has no effect on the process's signal mask.

RETURN VALUE
       sigsuspend() always returns -1, with errno set to inndicate the error (normally, EINTR).

ERRORS
       EFAULT mask points to memory which is not a valid part of the process address space.

       EINTR  The call was interrupted by a signal.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Normally,  sigsuspend()  is used in conjunction with sigprocmask(2) in order to prevent delivery of a signal during the execution of a critical code section.  The caller first blocks the signals with sigprocmask(2).  When the
       critical code has completed, the caller then waits for the signals by calling sigsuspend() with the signal mask that was returned by sigprocmask(2) (in the oldset argument).

       See sigsetops(3) for details on manipulating signal sets.
