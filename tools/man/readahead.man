NAME
       readahead - perform file readahead into page cache

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <fcntl.h>

       ssize_t readahead(int fd, off64_t offset, size_t count);

DESCRIPTION
       readahead()  populates the page cache with data from a file so that subsequent reads from that file will not block on disk I/O.  The fd argument is a file descriptor identifying the file which is to be read.  The offset argu‚Äê
       ment specifies the starting point from which data is to be read and count specifies the number of bytes to be read.  I/O is performed in whole pages, so that offset is effectively rounded down to a page boundary and bytes are
       read  up  to  the  next page boundary greater than or equal to (offset+count).  readahead() does not read beyond the end of the file.  readahead() blocks until the specified data has been read.  The current file offset of the
       open file referred to by fd is left unchanged.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, readahead() returns 0; on failure, -1 is returned, with errno set to indicate the cause of the error.

ERRORS
       EBADF  fd is not a valid file descriptor or is not open for reading.

       EINVAL fd does not refer to a file type to which readahead() can be applied.

VERSIONS
       The readahead() system call appeared in Linux 2.4.13; glibc support has been provided since version 2.3.

CONFORMING TO
       The readahead() system call is Linux-specific, and its use should be avoided in portable applications.

NOTES
       On some 32-bit architectures, the calling signature for this system call differs, for the reasons described in syscall(2).
