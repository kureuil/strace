NAME
       setresuid, setresgid - set real, effective and saved user or group ID

SYNOPSIS
       #define _GNU_SOURCE         /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setresuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid, uid_t suid);
       int setresgid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid, gid_t sgid);

DESCRIPTION
       setresuid() sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the calling process.

       Unprivileged user processes may change the real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID, each to one of: the current real UID, the current effective UID or the current saved set-user-ID.

       Privileged processes (on Linux, those having the CAP_SETUID capability) may set the real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID to arbitrary values.

       If one of the arguments equals -1, the corresponding value is not changed.

       Regardless of what changes are made to the real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID, the filesystem UID is always set to the same value as the (possibly new) effective UID.

       Completely  analogously, setresgid() sets the real GID, effective GID, and saved set-group-ID of the calling process (and always modifies the filesystem GID to be the same as the effective GID), with the same restrictions for
       unprivileged processes.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EAGAIN uid does not match the current UID and this call would bring that user ID over its RLIMIT_NPROC resource limit.

       EPERM  The calling process is not privileged (did not have the CAP_SETUID capability) and tried to change the IDs to values that are not permitted.

VERSIONS
       These calls are available under Linux since Linux 2.1.44.

CONFORMING TO
       These calls are nonstandard; they also appear on HP-UX and some of the BSDs.

NOTES
       Under HP-UX and FreeBSD, the prototype is found in <unistd.h>.  Under Linux the prototype is provided by glibc since version 2.3.2.

       The original Linux setresuid() and setresgid() system calls supported only 16-bit user and group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added setresuid32() and setresgid32(), supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc setresuid()  and  setres‚Äê
       gid() wrapper functions transparently deal with the variations across kernel versions.
