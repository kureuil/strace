NAME
       inotify_add_watch - add a watch to an initialized inotify instance

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/inotify.h>

       int inotify_add_watch(int fd, const char *pathname, uint32_t mask);

DESCRIPTION
       inotify_add_watch() adds a new watch, or modifies an existing watch, for the file whose location is specified in pathname; the caller must have read permission for this file.  The fd argument is a file descriptor referring to
       the inotify instance whose watch list is to be modified.  The events to be monitored for pathname are specified in the mask bit-mask argument.  See inotify(7) for a description of the bits that can be set in mask.

       A successful call to inotify_add_watch() returns the unique watch descriptor associated with pathname for this inotify instance.  If pathname was not previously being watched by this inotify instance, then the watch  descrip‐
       tor is newly allocated.  If pathname was already being watched, then the descriptor for the existing watch is returned.

       The  watch descriptor is returned by later read(2)s from the inotify file descriptor.  These reads fetch inotify_event structures (see inotify(7)) indicating filesystem events; the watch descriptor inside this structure iden‐
       tifies the object for which the event occurred.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, inotify_add_watch() returns a nonnegative watch descriptor.  On error -1 is returned and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EACCES Read access to the given file is not permitted.

       EBADF  The given file descriptor is not valid.

       EFAULT pathname points outside of the process's accessible address space.

       EINVAL The given event mask contains no valid events; or fd is not an inotify file descriptor.

       ENOENT A directory component in pathname does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ENOSPC The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource.

VERSIONS
       Inotify was merged into the 2.6.13 Linux kernel.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux-specific.
