NAME
       getsid - get session ID

SYNOPSIS
       #include <unistd.h>

       pid_t getsid(pid_t pid);

   Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):

       getsid():
           _XOPEN_SOURCE >= 500 || _XOPEN_SOURCE && _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED
           || /* Since glibc 2.12: */ _POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L

DESCRIPTION
       getsid(0) returns the session ID of the calling process.  getsid(p) returns the session ID of the process with process ID p.  (The session ID of a process is the process group ID of the session leader.)

RETURN VALUE
       On success, a session ID is returned.  On error, (pid_t) -1 will be returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  A process with process ID p exists, but it is not in the same session as the calling process, and the implementation considers this an error.

       ESRCH  No process with process ID p was found.

VERSIONS
       This system call is available on Linux since version 2.0.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       Linux does not return EPERM.
