NAME
       restart_syscall - restart a system call after interruption by a stop signal

SYNOPSIS
       int restart_syscall(void);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       The  restart_syscall()  system  call  is  used  to  restart  certain system calls after a process that was stopped by a signal (e.g., SIGSTOP or SIGTSTP) is later resumed after receiving a SIGCONT signal.  This system call is
       designed only for internal use by the kernel.

       restart_syscall() is used for restarting only those system calls that, when restarted, should adjust their time-related parametersâ€”namely poll(2) (since Linux 2.6.24), nanosleep(2) (since Linux 2.6), clock_nanosleep(2) (since
       Linux  2.6),  and  futex(2),  when  employed with the FUTEX_WAIT (since Linux 2.6.22) and FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET (since Linux 2.6.31) operations.  restart_syscall() restarts the interrupted system call with a time argument that is
       suitably adjusted to account for the time that has already elapsed (including the time where the process was stopped by a signal).  Without the restart_syscall() mechanism, restarting these system calls  would  not  correctly
       deduce the already elapsed time when the process continued execution.

RETURN VALUE
       The return value of restart_syscall() is the return value of whatever system call is being restarted.

ERRORS
       errno is set as per the errors for whatever system call is being restarted by restart_syscall().

VERSIONS
       The restart_syscall() system call is present since Linux 2.6.

CONFORMING TO
       This system call is Linux specific.

NOTES
       There is no glibc wrapper for this system call, because it is intended for use only by the kernel and should never be called by applications.

       From user space, the operation of restart_syscall(2) is largely invisible: to the process that made the system call that is restarted, it appears as though that system call executed and returned in the usual fashion.
