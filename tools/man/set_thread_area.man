NAME
       set_thread_area - set a thread local storage (TLS) area

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/unistd.h>
       #include <asm/ldt.h>

       int set_thread_area(struct user_desc *u_info);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       set_thread_area() sets an entry in the current thread's thread-local storage (TLS) array.  The TLS array entry set by set_thread_area() corresponds to the value of u_info->entry_number passed in by the user.  If this value is
       in bounds, set_thread_area() copies the TLS descriptor pointed to by u_info into the thread's TLS array.

       When set_thread_area() is passed an entry_number of -1, it uses a free TLS entry.  If set_thread_area() finds a free TLS entry, the value of u_info->entry_number is set upon return to show which entry was changed.

RETURN VALUE
       set_thread_area() returns 0 on success, and -1 on failure, with errno set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL u_info->entry_number is out of bounds.

       EFAULT u_info is an invalid pointer.

       ESRCH  A free TLS entry could not be located.

VERSIONS
       A version of set_thread_area() first appeared in Linux 2.5.29.

CONFORMING TO
       set_thread_area() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call, since it is generally intended only for use by threading libraries.  In the unlikely event that you want to call it directly, use syscall(2).
