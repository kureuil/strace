NAME
       personality - set the process execution domain

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/personality.h>

       int personality(unsigned long persona);

DESCRIPTION
       Linux  supports  different  execution  domains, or personalities, for each process.  Among other things, execution domains tell Linux how to map signal numbers into signal actions.  The execution domain system allows Linux to
       provide limited support for binaries compiled under other UNIX-like operating systems.

       This function will return the current personality() when persona equals 0xffffffff.  Otherwise, it will make the execution domain referenced by persona the new execution domain of the calling process.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, the previous persona is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The kernel was unable to change the personality.

CONFORMING TO
       personality() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended to be portable.
