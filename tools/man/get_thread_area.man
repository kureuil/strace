NAME
       get_thread_area - get a thread-local storage (TLS) area

SYNOPSIS
       #include <linux/unistd.h>
       #include <asm/ldt.h>

       int get_thread_area(struct user_desc *u_info);

       Note: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

DESCRIPTION
       get_thread_area()  returns  an  entry  in  the  current  thread's  thread-local storage (TLS) array.  The index of the entry corresponds to the value of u_info->entry_number, passed in by the user.  If the value is in bounds,
       get_thread_area() copies the corresponding TLS entry into the area pointed to by u_info.

RETURN VALUE
       get_thread_area() returns 0 on success.  Otherwise, it returns -1 and sets errno appropriately.

ERRORS
       EFAULT u_info is an invalid pointer.

       EINVAL u_info->entry_number is out of bounds.

VERSIONS
       A version of get_thread_area() first appeared in Linux 2.5.32.

CONFORMING TO
       get_thread_area() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs that are intended to be portable.

NOTES
       Glibc does not provide a wrapper for this system call, since it is generally intended for use only by threading libraries.  In the unlikely event that you want to call it directly, use syscall(2).
