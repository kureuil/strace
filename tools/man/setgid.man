NAME
       setgid - set group identity

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

       int setgid(gid_t gid);

DESCRIPTION
       setgid() sets the effective group ID of the calling process.  If the caller is the superuser, the real GID and saved set-group-ID are also set.

       Under  Linux, setgid() is implemented like the POSIX version with the _POSIX_SAVED_IDS feature.  This allows a set-group-ID program that is not set-user-ID-root to drop all of its group privileges, do some un-privileged work,
       and then reengage the original effective group ID in a secure manner.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EPERM  The calling process is not privileged (does not have the CAP_SETGID capability), and gid does not match the real group ID or saved set-group-ID of the calling process.

CONFORMING TO
       SVr4, POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The original Linux setgid() system call supported only 16-bit group IDs.  Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added setgid32() supporting 32-bit IDs.  The glibc setgid() wrapper function transparently deals with the variation across ker‚Äê
       nel versions.
