NAME
       sched_get_priority_max, sched_get_priority_min  - get static priority range

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sched.h>

       int sched_get_priority_max(int policy);

       int sched_get_priority_min(int policy);

DESCRIPTION
       sched_get_priority_max()  returns the maximum priority value that can be used with the scheduling algorithm identified by policy.  sched_get_priority_min() returns the minimum priority value that can be used with the schedul‚Äê
       ing algorithm identified by policy.  Supported policy values are SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, SCHED_OTHER, and SCHED_BATCH.  Further details about these policies can be found in sched_setscheduler(2).

       Processes with numerically higher priority values are scheduled before processes with numerically lower priority values.  Thus, the value returned by sched_get_priority_max()  will  be  greater  than  the  value  returned  by
       sched_get_priority_min().

       Linux allows the static priority value range 1 to 99 for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR and the priority 0 for SCHED_OTHER and SCHED_BATCH.  Scheduling priority ranges for the various policies are not alterable.

       The  range  of  scheduling  priorities  may  vary  on  other  POSIX  systems,  thus  it is a good idea for portable applications to use a virtual priority range and map it to the interval given by sched_get_priority_max() and
       sched_get_priority_min().  POSIX.1-2001 requires a spread of at least 32 between the maximum and the minimum values for SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR.

       POSIX systems on which sched_get_priority_max() and sched_get_priority_min() are available define _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, sched_get_priority_max() and sched_get_priority_min() return the maximum/minimum priority value for the named scheduling policy.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.

ERRORS
       EINVAL The argument policy does not identify a defined scheduling policy.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.
